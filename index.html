      <h2>Overthinking -- Forbes</h2>
      <p>
        Whether they’re beating themselves up over a mistake they made
        yesterday, or they're fretting about how they’re going to succeed
        tomorrow, over-thinkers are plagued by distressing thoughts. Their
        inability to get out of their own heads leaves them in a state of
        constant anguish.
      </p>
      <p>
        While everyone over-thinks things once in a while, some people just
        can’t ever seem to quiet the constant barrage of thoughts. Their inner
        monologue includes two destructive thought patterns -- ruminating and
        worrying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruminating involves rehashing the past. Thoughts may include things
        like:
      </p>
      <p>
        - I shouldn’t have spoken up in the meeting today. Everyone looked at me
        like I was an idiot.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        - I could have stuck it out at my old job. I would be happier if I would
        have just stayed there.
      </p>
      <p>
        - My parents always said I wouldn’t amount to anything. And they were
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worrying involves negative--often catastrophic--predictions about the
        future. They may think things like:
      </p>
      <p>
        - I’m going to embarrass myself tomorrow when I give that presentation.
        My hands will shake, my face will turn red, and everyone will see that
        I’m incompetent.
      </p>
      <div></div>
      <p>
        - I’ll never get promoted. It doesn’t matter what I do. It’s not going
        to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        - My spouse is going to find someone better than I am. I’m going to end
        up divorced and alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over-thinkers don’t just use words to contemplate their lives.
        Sometimes, they conjure up images too. They may envision their car going
        off the road or they might replay a distressing event in their minds
        like a movie. Either way, their tendency to overthink everything holds
        them back from doing something productive.
      </p>
      <p><strong>The Dangers Of Overthinking</strong></p>
      <p>
        Thinking too much about things isn’t just a nuisance. It can take a
        serious toll on your well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Research</em> says dwelling on your shortcomings, mistakes, and
        problems increases your risk of mental health problems. And as your
        mental health declines, your tendency to ruminate increases, which can
        lead to a vicious cycle that is hard to break.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Studies</em>
        also show that overthinking leads to serious emotional distress. To
        escape that distress, many over-thinkers resort to unhealthy coping
        strategies, such as alcohol or food.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re an over-thinker you likely already know you can’t sleep when
        your mind won’t shut off.
        <em>Studies</em>
        confirm this, finding that rumination and worry lead to fewer hours of
        sleep and poorer sleep quality.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How To Stop Overthinking</strong></p>
      <p>
        Putting an end to rehashing, second-guessing, and catastrophic
        predictions is easier said than done. But with consistent practice, you
        can limit your negative thinking patterns. Here are six ways to stop
        overthinking everything:
      </p>
      <p><strong>1. Notice When You’re Thinking Too Much</strong></p>
      <p>
        Awareness is the first step in putting an end to overthinking. Start
        paying attention to the way you think. When you notice you’re re-playing
        events in your mind over and over, or worrying about things you can’t
        control, acknowledge that your thoughts aren’t productive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Challenge Your Thoughts</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s easy to get carried away with negative thoughts. So before you
        conclude that calling in sick is going to get you fired, or that
        forgetting one deadline is going to cause you to become homeless,
        acknowledge that your thoughts may be exaggeratedly negative. Learn to
        <em>recognize and replace thinking errors</em>, before they work you up
        into a complete frenzy.
      </p>
      <p><strong>3. Keep The Focus On Active Problem-Solving</strong></p>
      <p>
        Dwelling on your problems isn’t helpful--but looking for solutions is.
        Ask yourself what steps you can take to learn from a mistake or to avoid
        a future problem. Instead of asking <em>why did this happen?</em> Ask
        yourself <em>what can I do about it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Schedule Time For Reflection</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Stewing on your problems for long periods of time isn’t productive, but
        brief reflection can be helpful. Thinking about how you could do things
        differently or recognizing potential pitfalls to your plan, for example,
        can help you do better in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incorporate 20 minutes of “thinking time” into your daily schedule.
        During that time, let yourself worry, ruminate, or mull over whatever
        you want. Then, when your time is up, move onto something more
        productive. When you notice yourself overthinking things outside of your
        scheduled time, remind yourself that you’ll think about that later.
      </p>
      <p><strong>5. Practice Mindfulness</strong></p>
      <p>
        It’s impossible to rehash yesterday or worry about
        <span><span>tomorrow</span></span> when you’re living in the present.
        Commit to becoming more aware of the here and now. Just like any other
        skill, mindfulness takes practice, but over time, it can decrease
        overthinking.
      </p>
      <p><strong>6. Change The Channel</strong></p>
      <p>
        Telling yourself to stop thinking about something can backfire. The more
        you try to avoid the thought from entering your brain, the more likely
        it is to keep popping up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Busying yourself with an activity is the best way to change the channel.
        Exercise, engage in conversation on a completely different subject, or
        get working on a project that will distract your mind from the barrage
        of negative thoughts.

      <h2>How to Stop Overthinking</h2>
      <h3>
        Part-1 <b><em>Letting Go of Your Thoughts</em></b>
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Accept that you're thinking too much.</b> Just like eating,
          thinking is something we need to do to survive, so it is sometimes
          hard to judge when you are doing too much of it. However, there are
          several red flags that you are doing too much thinking for your own
          good. Here are a few of them:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Are you consumed by the same thought over and over again? Are you
              not making progress by thinking about this particular thing? If
              so, this may be a sign that you should move on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have you analyzed the same situation from a million angles? If
              you've found too many ways to look at something before you decide
              how to act, you may be being counterproductive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Have you enlisted the help of your twenty closest friends in
              thinking about a particular thing? If so, then it's time to
              realize that you can only ask for so many opinions about the same
              idea before you drive yourself insane.
            </li>
            <li>
              Are people constantly telling you to stop over-thinking things? Do
              people tease you for brooding, being a philosopher, or staring out
              of rainy windows all the time? If so, they may have a point.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Meditate.</b> If you feel like you don't know how to stop thinking,
          you need to learn what it's like to "let go" of your thoughts, so that
          it's something you can do deliberately. Imagine that thinking is like
          breathing; you do it all the time, without even realizing it. But if
          you need to, you can hold your breath. Meditating will help you learn
          how to release your thoughts.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Just spending 15-20 minutes meditating every morning can make a
              dramatic impact on your ability to stay in the present and let go
              of all of your nagging thoughts.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also meditate at night to help yourself wind down.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Exercise.</b> Running or even walking vigorously can help you take
          your mind off of all of those annoying thoughts and to focus on your
          body. Participating in something particularly active, like power yoga,
          martial arts or beach volleyball, will have you so focused on your
          body that you won't have time for your thoughts. Here are some great
          things to try:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Join a circuit gym. Having to switch to a new machine every minute
              when you hear that bell ring will keep you from getting lost in
              your thoughts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Go hiking. Being around nature and seeing the beauty and stillness
              around you will keep you more focused on the present moment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Go swimming. Swimming is such a physical activity that it's even
              harder to swim and think.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Say your ideas out loud.
          </b>
          Once you've said everything aloud, even if you're talking to yourself,
          you've begun the process of letting go. Walk around and pace if you
          have to. Once you've put your ideas out there, you've begun the
          process of putting them out into the world and out of your thoughts.
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can say them aloud to yourself, your cat, or to a trusted
              friend.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Ask for advice.
          </b>
          You may have exhausted your own thinking power, but someone else might
          be able to offer a different perspective that makes the decision
          clearer. This can help let go of your troubling thoughts. Your friend
          can make you feel better, can ease your problems, and can also make
          you realize when you're spending way too much time thinking.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Besides, if you're hanging out with a friend, you're not just
              thinking, right? That's something.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        Part-2 <b><em>Taking Control of Your Thoughts</em></b>
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>
            Make a practical list of the things that are troubling you.
          </b>
          Whether you're writing on paper or a computer, you should first define
          a problem, write down your options, and then list the pros and cons
          for each option. Seeing your thoughts in front of you will also help
          you stop cycling through them in your head. Once you can't think of
          anything more to write, your mind has done its job, and it's time to
          stop thinking.
          <ul>
            <li>
              If making a list still doesn't help you make a decision, don't be
              afraid to follow your intuition. If two or more options seem
              equally appealing, thinking more will not make things clearer.
              This is when you should listen to something deeper.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Keep a diary of the things that are troubling you.
          </b>
          Instead of lingering over your most persistent thoughts, jot down all
          of the things on your mind every day. At the end of one week, go over
          what you've written and make a note of the things that are troubling
          you the most. You need to deal with those first.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Try to write in your diary at least a few times a week. This will
              help you get used to the idea of a "thinking time" and will help
              you sit down with your thoughts, instead of having them trouble
              you throughout the day.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Have a to-do list.
          </b>
          Make a list of all the things you have to do on a certain day. Unless
          "brooding" is on your list of priorities, this will force you to see
          that you have more important things to do than to sit around pondering
          the meaning of the universe! The quickest way to organize your
          thoughts is to put them into something actionable. If you're thinking
          that you haven't gotten enough sleep lately, make a plan for getting
          some Z's pronto instead of worrying about it!
          <ul>
            <li>
              The list can be practical and can deal with the bigger things,
              like: "spend more time with my family."
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Set a "thinking time" aside for yourself every day.
          </b>
          This may sound crazy, but picking a time every day for yourself to
          worry, wonder, be dreamy, and to get lost in your thoughts can help
          you control your thoughts in a more productive manner. If you need to,
          give yourself an hour, say, from 5-6:00 every day. Then, try to get
          the time down to 5-5:30. If an upsetting thought comes up earlier in
          the day when it's inconvenient to deal with it, just tell yourself,
          "I'll worry about that at 5 pm."
          <ul>
            <li>
              This may sound ridiculous, but you've got to try it before you
              knock it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>
        Part-3 <b><em> Living in the Moment</em></b>
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>
            Solve as many problems as you can.
          </b>
          If your problem is that you think too much about nothing, worry for no
          reason, or think about things you can't control, then there's not much
          you can do to "solve" the problems that are plaguing your thoughts.
          But think of the ones you can solve and make an active plan for going
          about doing so, instead of thinking, thinking, thinking without it
          going anywhere. Here are some ideas for what you can do:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Instead of thinking about whether or not your crush likes you,
              take action! Ask him or her out. What's the worst that can happen?
            </li>
            <li>
              If you're worried that you're falling behind in work or school,
              make a list of all of the things you can do to succeed. And then
              do those things!
            </li>
            <li>
              If you like to think, "What if..." a lot, try to do the things
              that are feasible.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            Be social.
          </b>
          Surrounding yourself with people you love will keep you talking more
          and thinking less. Make sure to get out of the house at least a few
          times a week, and make a point of working to develop lasting and
          meaningful relationships with at least two or three people in your
          area that you can hang out with. You'll be much more prone to thinking
          if you spend a lot of time by yourself.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Alone time is definitely a good thing, but it's important to mix

              loose, and have fun.

            Get a new hobby.
          </b>
          Take the time to explore something completely different and out of
          your comfort zone. A new hobby, no matter what it is, will keep you
          focused on the task at hand as well as interested in getting results.
          Don't think that you already know what you like and don't need any
          more distractions. Trying a new hobby can help you live in the moment
          and focus on your art, your craft, or whatever. Try some of these:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Write a poem or a short story
            </li>
            <li>
              Take a night class in history
            </li>
            <li>
              Take a pottery or ceramics class
            </li>
            <li>
              Take up surfing
            </li>
            <li>
              Try biking instead of driving
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>

            Explore nature.
          </b>
          Get outside and start looking at the trees, smelling the roses, and
          feeling fresh water on your face. That will help you live in the
          moment, embrace nature and the impermanence of your existence, and to
          see a world outside of the one you created inside your own head. Put
          on your sunblock and your sneakers and stop being cooped up in your
          bedroom.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Even if you're not into hiking, running, biking, or surfing, make
              a goal of walking through a park at least once or twice a week,
              taking a weekend trip to something nature-related with your
              friends during your next vacation, or just going somewhere were
              you can stare out at a big blue lake or ocean.
            </li>
            <li>
              And if that seems like too much work for you, just go outside.
              Being out in the sun will make you happier, healthier, and less
              likely to brood.

            Read more.
          </b>
          Focusing on the thoughts of other people will not only give you
          insight, but will keep you from thinking about yourself too much. In
          fact, reading biographies of inspirational men and women "of action"
          may inspire you to see that behind every great thought, there is an
          equally great action. And reading books can also not make you want to
          do anything except for escape to a new world for a while, which is
          also nice.

            Make a gratitude list.
          </b>
          Every day, make a list of at least five things you are grateful for.
          This will make you focus on people and things instead of thoughts. If
          every day is too much, try doing it every week. Mix it up. Every
          little thing counts, even the barista who gives you a free refill of
          your coffee.

            Appreciate beautiful music.
          </b>
          Listening to a great song can make you feel in touch with the world
          outside your own head. You can do this by going to a concert, playing
          an old CD in your car, or even getting a record player and some LPs
          and going old school. Close your eyes, soak in the notes, and live in
          the now.
          <ul>
            <li>
              It doesn't have to be Mozart or something meaningful or
              hoity-toity. Listening to Katy Perry can do the trick too!

            Laugh more.
          </b>
          Be around people who make you laugh. Go to a comedy club. Watch a
          comedy or a TV show with a funny cast that you really like. Watch some
          funny YouTube videos. Do whatever you have to do to make yourself
          crack up, toss your head back, and not care about all of the things
          that are on your mind. Don't underestimate the importance the role of
          laughter plays in your mental health.
